So, it can be journaling in the form of old school kind of paper. It can be journaling in the form of dictation. In fact, that's part of what attracted me to the evermore app. And again, this is not a sales pitch. I'm just saying it is a voice journal. And I felt like it was a really great way for me to express myself quickly and privately in the moment. And so for paper journaling, or any kind of voice memos or whatever tools work best for you, when you capture your stream of consciousness thoughts about any topic, whether they be a happy thing, or sad thing or challenging thing or nervous thing or whatever they may be. They kind of get you to reflect and crystallize within yourself. What is my position on this? Do I really want to hold these beliefs do I need to shift them and what do I need to get there? So it's kind of like if you think about anything in a in a career setting, or even in a parenting setting if you don't work outside the home, and something is quote unquote, wrong or broken.
