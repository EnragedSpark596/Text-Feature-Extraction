So listen, despite that, past self that is clearly different than our present self. We think of who we are right now as you know, real and finished versions, and I was definitely one of those people. So I had a journey that went through several different kinds of disciplines over the years from, you know, the clinical side and therapeutic practice from the pharmaceutical side working in house at pharmaceutical companies and then as a partner, which I still do although I've shifted my work to smaller emerging technology, technology based startup companies.
