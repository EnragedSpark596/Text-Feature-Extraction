Does that see isn't it it's it keeps stretching that comfort zone of where we feel we belong or what we can achieve is just pushing those boundaries. And and then you know, exceeding them. It's it's like, as you say, those small steps, those small goals that you take just to keep pushing those boundaries further and further, and you can knowingly kind of trick yourself and that was one of the great things in you are the placebo. And because they had all these clinical studies around people who were sort of told, like, tell yourself this, and it's still work like they had some octogenarian 80 something year old men. They instructed them for two weeks to kind of imagine that they were in their 20s and try not to look in the mirror too much and try to like really, just as much as you could from the moment you went wake up. And they of course, in the beginning of the study, they took blood pressure, and all the resting heart rates and all these biological markers.
