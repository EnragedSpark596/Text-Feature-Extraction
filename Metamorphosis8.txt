This is a little corny. So I've been very fortunate to have lived and traveled much of the globe. And yet I have very simple needs any place where there is still a vast water and forest nearby like nature that's untouched and you know, pretty alone with you know, some loved ones they could be you know, children, spouse, friends, what have you just like a very low key quiet with a beautiful scenery.
